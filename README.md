# GCP, AI4BHARAT, OpenAI exploration 
The main objective of this project was to translate(1 language to another) and transliterate(Same Pronunciation, Different Script) the MMLU(Massive Multitask Language Understanding) dataset from huggingface from english to hindi using GCP, OpenAI and AI4BHARAT.

In GCP I used the cloud translation api to do the task and used Modal labs GPU to run the AI4BHARAT model as neither my laptop's GPU nor Google Collab's free GPU tier was not enough to run it.
